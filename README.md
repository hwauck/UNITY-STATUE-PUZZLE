# UNITY-STATUE-PUZZLE

This game is a simple low fidelity port of the infamous "statue puzzle" from the video game "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess", but modified to incorporate intelligent 
hints. The goal of the hints is to reduce player frustration and attrition by pointing the player towards helpful strategies without giving away the solution. The results of
a study evaluating the effectiveness of the adaptive hints in this game can be found in my IUI 2017 paper here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025171.3025224

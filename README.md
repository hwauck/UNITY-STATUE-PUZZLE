# UNITY-STATUE-PUZZLE

This game is a simple low fidelity port of the infamous "statue puzzle" from the video game "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess", but modified to incorporate intelligent 
hints. The goal of the hints is to reduce player frustration and attrition by pointing the player towards helpful strategies without giving away the solution. The results of
a study evaluating the effectiveness of the adaptive hints in this game can be found in my IUI 2017 paper here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025171.3025224

Also included in this project is the source code for two more ports of Zelda puzzle minigames (floor tile puzzles from Oracle of Ages and 2D versions of ice block puzzles from Twilight Princess) as well as code for embedding them within an online research study.
